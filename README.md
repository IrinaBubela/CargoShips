to run the project:

you have to run the server which returns all the data, typing this command in the console:
1. npm run json-server

you have to run the scripts (front-end part and packages needed for the project):
2. npm run start

you will be automatically redirected to the page with specific port, if not go to:
package.json and check `port` of `json-server`, e.g it's 5000, then in browser you should open the page, typing `localhost:5000` in a url placeholder
3. localhost:5000
